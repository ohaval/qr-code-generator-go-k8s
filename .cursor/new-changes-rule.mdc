# Make command and Makefile

- Always prefer to use make commands when running terminal commands, or when implementing bash scripts/CI CD scripts. The idea is that the Makefile will be a source of high-quality set of actions we might want to do.

# Lint And Test On Changes

The instruction is to always run `make lint` and `make lt` to make sure no linting or test errors, and

# Documentation

After making some changes, always look at the docs around it and see if they need an update or not. Also very important to keep the `Makefile` file and the `README.md` always up to date, also check on them often and especially after changes. Another important files are `docs/STRUCTURE.md` and `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - keep them update after changes.

## Feature And Development Tracking

In features documentation/plan files, any steps file, always track what we have done and what's not. Use the âœ… emoji as it's a great way to sign on specific items that were done. Also use emojis in scripts for verbosity.
